# Wordle Evolved

This web application expands upon the game of Wordle. It provides the ability for users to create their own Wordle game variants by changing the word length, the number of guesses, the letters used for word selection, and so on. Users will be able to login to record their statistics and compete against each other on leaderboards for unique Wordle games that they have constructed.
